NOTE : Temporary registers are considered as
       variables of the intermediate language. 
       Variable 'R0' (that refers to the 
       physical register 'R0') is always 
       considered LIVE-IN for each node of 
       a basic block. 
       Thus, in the following control flow graph, 
       'R0' will never appear as LIVE-IN or LIVE-OUT
       variable for a statement.

       If you want to consider 'R0' as
       a normal variable, you have to set
       to 0 the value of the macro CFLOW_ALWAYS_LIVEIN_R0
       defined in "cflow_constants.h".
